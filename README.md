# ProbabilityCalculator
## Requirements
- .NET 7
- Node (tested with version 18.7)

## Setup
You can either run the solution through an IDE (Visual Studio 2022 was used) or by running `dotnet run` in the `ProbabilityCalculator.Web` folder.

On the first run npm packages will be installed, so this might take a while. Upon first load the React app will be built automatically. 
You should be automatically redirected once this is complete.
